# cblink

This demo is my first attempt at programming the Pi GPIO.


## Usage

This program expects an LED hooked up to pin 16, 
and a switch hooked up to pin 17.

  make && sudo ./blink

the program accepts the following commands:

 * on - turn on the LED
 * off - turn off the LED
 * button - turn on the LED, and wait for button press, which turns off the LED
